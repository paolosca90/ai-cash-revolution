# CORS Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Solved
Fixed CORS errors that were causing the frontend to show blank pages after registration on Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Express Backend CORS Configuration (`express-backend/api/index.js`)
- ✅ Added specific origin allowlist including production Vercel URLs
- ✅ Configured proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- ✅ Added explicit preflight request handling with `app.options('*', cors(corsOptions))`
- ✅ Set appropriate headers for CORS credentials and browser compatibility

### 2. Vercel Infrastructure CORS (`express-backend/vercel.json`)  
- ✅ Added CORS headers at the Vercel edge level for all `/api/*` routes
- ✅ Configured Access-Control-Allow-Origin for production frontend URLs
- ✅ Set cache control with Access-Control-Max-Age for preflight requests
- ✅ Enabled credentials support for authenticated requests

### 3. Frontend Error Handling (`frontend/lib/api-client.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced CORS error detection and logging
- ✅ Improved error messages for development debugging
- ✅ Added production fallback to mock data when backend is unavailable
- ✅ Fixed localhost port configuration (3001 → 3002)

## Endpoints Fixed
All problematic endpoints now have proper CORS support:
- ✅ `/api/analysis/top-signals`
- ✅ `/api/ml/analytics` 
- ✅ `/api/analysis/performance`
- ✅ `/api/analysis/history`

## Testing Results
- ✅ All preflight OPTIONS requests return 200 with proper headers
- ✅ All GET requests work with CORS origin validation
- ✅ Frontend can successfully call backend APIs
- ✅ Both development and production configurations tested

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment (Vercel)
```bash
cd express-backend
vercel --prod
```

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

## URLs Configured
- **Frontend**: `https://ai-cash-revolution-frontend.vercel.app`
- **Backend**: `https://ai-cash-revolution-backend-nkcdzubal-paolos-projects-dc6990da.vercel.app`
- **Alternative Origins**: Also supports additional Vercel deployments

## Security Notes
- CORS origins are explicitly allowlisted (no wildcard *)
- Credentials are enabled for authenticated requests
- Headers are restricted to necessary ones only
- Preflight requests are cached for 24 hours (86400 seconds)

## Local Development
The configuration also supports local development:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3002`
- All CORS rules apply in development mode
